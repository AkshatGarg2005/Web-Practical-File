question: 14) Difference between JavaScript and jQuery.
answer:

JavaScript: the language + browser/Node APIs (DOM, fetch, events, classes, modules).

jQuery: a JS library that simplified old cross-browser DOM, events, AJAX, and animations via $() and chaining.

Today: modern JS (querySelector, classList, fetch, async/await) and CSS transitions reduce the need for jQuery.

Use jQuery when: maintaining legacy apps or using specific jQuery plugins.

Pros/cons: jQuery = quick, consistent, plugin-rich but extra weight; plain JS = no dependency, faster, idiomatic now.

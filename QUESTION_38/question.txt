question: 12) What is form validation?
answer:

Definition: verify inputs match rules before processing to keep data clean and secure.

Client-side: HTML5 constraints + JS for instant feedback (required, type="email", pattern, min/max).

Server-side: mandatory final checkâ€”sanitize, escape, enforce business rules/authorization.

API/CSS: checkValidity(), reportValidity(), setCustomValidity(), and selectors :invalid, :required.

Good UX: clear labels, inline error text, focus first invalid field, accessible (aria-invalid).

Common mistakes: relying only on client side, weak regex, leaking detailed server errors.

question: Q1. Explain the different types of switching and their advantages and disadvantages.
answer:

Circuit switching: dedicated end-to-end path. Advantages: guaranteed bandwidth/low jitter; predictable. Disadvantages: setup delay; wastes capacity for bursty traffic; single failure breaks call.

Packet switching:

Datagram (IP): each packet routed independently. Advantages: efficient, robust. Disadvantages: variable delay, reordering/loss.

Virtual circuit (e.g., MPLS/Frame Relay): logical path pre-set. Advantages: ordering/QoS options. Disadvantages: setup/state overhead.

Message switching (store-and-forward whole message). Advantages: no dedicated path needed. Disadvantages: very high delay; obsolete.

Cell switching (ATM, fixed-size cells). Advantages: low jitter/QoS. Disadvantages: overhead/complex; legacy.
